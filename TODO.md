- [ ] allow remaining accounts to be passed in
- [ ] a builder to allow users to create plugin data more easily
- [ ] instructions
    - [ ] CreateAsset
    - [ ] CreateCollection
    - [ ] Transfer

    - Is it faster to first go over the arguments and calculate their size, or allocate a magic sized array and start serializing into it? I do the latter for now
    - There is also no error handling for going out of bounds, making this slow and also unpredictable
    - Add option to use a Vec
- [ ] Add V2
    The only difference I see are the external plugins
